# Study 002 Work Log

## 2026-07-16 — Activation and pre-candidate setup (cycle 1 of at most 6)

### Work completed

- Re-read the frozen Study 002 proposal at commit `68fc4c2edb93ca1363e7b7040221b5507cfeb171` and activated it without changing its commitments.
- Created `PROTOCOL.md` with the frozen question, hypotheses, candidate counts, exact-analysis requirements, resource caps, comparison screens, success conditions, immediate failure conditions, out-of-scope claims, intervention model, and six-cycle limit.
- Froze generation seed `2026071602`.
- Froze the six board-size × mechanism-family cells and exactly three candidates per cell.
- Froze canonical tuple serialization and cross-version deterministic SHA-256 ranking rather than relying on Python PRNG ordering.
- Defined a declarative immutable placement-game schema supporting adjacency growth, component expansion/merger, local enemy limits, edge connection, lines, component size, and fixture-only explicit patterns.
- Added candidate validation boundaries for board size, full-board use, intended symmetry, fixture-only features, and rule-word count.
- Defined four hand-audited fixture state graphs: immediate component win, single-cell draw, branching role-specific patterns, and an adjacency chain.
- Added deterministic schema, mechanism, grammar-count, and fixture-graph tests.
- Preserved the cycle boundary: no 18-entry manifest, exact solver, random screen, shallow screen, or candidate outcome was created or inspected.

### Verification

- In a local reconstruction, `python -m pytest -q` reported **10 passed**.
- `python -m compileall -q src tests` completed without error.
- The Git blob SHA for each remote schema, fixture, grammar, and new test file matched the corresponding locally tested file exactly.
- A fresh clone attempt failed because the execution environment could not resolve `github.com`; the full legacy suite was not rerun.
- No GitHub Actions workflow was available as a remote CI substitute.

### Correction during final audit

The adjacency-chain graph was initially annotated as symmetric under transpose plus player/color exchange. Its L-shaped playable mask is not invariant under transpose, so that claim was false even though the graph itself was correct. Before solver implementation or candidate generation, the symmetry claim was removed in both code and fixture documentation. The targeted suite was rerun and remained at **10 passed**. Fixtures 1 and 2 retain explicit symmetry claims; Fixtures 3 and 4 are intentionally treated as asymmetric.

### Result

The frozen representation is precise enough to generate static candidates in a later cycle and the four fixture graphs are machine-checkable before solver implementation. This is representation evidence only. It does not validate an exact solver or any game candidate.

### Decision

Advance to one manifest-only cycle. Implement the frozen canonical serializer and SHA-256 enumerator, generate exactly three statically valid candidates in each cell, freeze the 18 entries and their generated rule text, and require byte-identical regeneration. Do not implement or run the exact solver in that cycle.

### Human intervention

Yoshie Yamada supplied the plain `承認` trigger that enabled this repository cycle. This is **A1** access assistance. Activation, schema design, fixture design, grammar parameters, seed, tests, interpretation, and the next task were autonomous **A0** work.

## 2026-07-16 — Candidate manifest freeze (cycle 2 of at most 6)

### Work completed

- Implemented the frozen family parameter products and normalized aliases into ordered canonical objects.
- Serialized candidates as compact UTF-8 JSON and ranked them with the frozen SHA-256 formula using seed `2026071602`.
- Generated human-readable core rules and counted whitespace-delimited words before selection.
- Translated every tuple back into a candidate `GameSpec` for static validation.
- Selected the first three valid ranked tuples in each of the six frozen cells without manual ranking or replacement.
- Froze 18 IDs, canonical tuples, ranks, rule texts, word counts, and validation records under `manifest/`.
- Stored a deterministic index and overview plus one complete JSON file per candidate.
- Preserved the cycle boundary: no exact solver, state solve, random game, shallow game, outcome field, win rate, or quality ranking was created or inspected.

### Static result

- 3×3 and 4×4 adjacency-growth cells each produced 24 raw, 24 unique, and 24 statically valid tuples.
- 3×3 and 4×4 component-expansion cells each produced 24 raw, 24 unique, and 24 valid tuples.
- 3×3 and 4×4 local-block cells each produced 16 raw, 16 unique, and 16 valid tuples.
- All six cells therefore supplied three candidates without changing the grammar or seed.
- The final manifest contains exactly 18 unique IDs and 18 unique canonical tuples.
- Generated rules range from 83 to 142 words.
- Compact full-entry list SHA-256: `cff3a75a58442b843134cd05a337e2af3166e1c1e035c15fc890f576e0495cee`.

### Verification

- The generator was run twice and produced byte-identical JSON, Markdown, index, and eighteen candidate files.
- `tests/test_exact_first_manifest.py`: **7 passed**.
- `python -m compileall -q src tests experiments`: no errors.
- Git blob SHAs for `manifest.py`, the regeneration script, the final test, `index.json`, `README.md`, and all eighteen candidate files matched the locally verified files exactly.
- Fresh clone again failed because the environment could not resolve `github.com`.
- An attempted combined setup-plus-manifest run was discarded because its local reconstruction used a reduced schema snapshot rather than the complete live schema. No combined regression result is claimed.
- No GitHub Actions workflow was available.

### Result

The frozen grammar passed its static generation gate and produced the required reproducible candidate family without adaptive replacement. This is not evidence that any candidate is balanced, terminates well, is interesting, or can be solved within the resource caps.

### Decision

Advance to the exact-instrument correctness gate. Implement a generic memoized solver and a separately written brute-force fixture enumerator; compare outcomes, distances, opening-action values, and the two retained symmetry claims on the frozen fixtures. Do not solve the eighteen candidates in that cycle.

### Human intervention

Yoshie Yamada supplied the plain `承認` trigger that enabled this repository cycle. This is **A1** access assistance. Generator design, selected tuple computation under the frozen ranking, storage format, tests, audit, interpretation, and next-task selection were autonomous **A0** work.

## 2026-07-17 — Exact-instrument correctness gate (cycle 3 of at most 6)

### Work completed

- Implemented `solver.py`, a full-width memoized depth-first exact solver without symmetry reduction.
- Implemented `bruteforce.py`, an independent queue-built reachable graph followed by retrograde evaluation in descending ply order.
- Kept traversal, memoization, retrograde evaluation, and outcome-selection code separate between the two instruments.
- Fixed values to the participant-to-move perspective and action values to the acting participant's perspective.
- Fixed the outcome-preserving distance convention: wins shortest, losses longest, draws shortest.
- Added explicit state-cap and time-cap reasons; capped runs do not publish partial root or opening values.
- Cross-checked both instruments on every reachable state and every legal action of the four frozen fixtures.
- Checked only the retained color-role symmetry claims of Fixtures 1 and 2.
- Preserved the cycle boundary: no frozen candidate was solved, enumerated, played, or assigned an outcome.

### Fixture result

- Immediate component win: 2 states; root win in 1; A1 win in 1.
- Single-cell draw: 2 states; root draw in 1; A1 draw in 1.
- Branching pattern: 4 states; root win in 1; A1 win in 1; B1 loss in 2.
- Adjacency chain: 4 states; root win in 3; A1 win in 3.
- The two instruments agreed on all twelve states, all distances, all action values, and state counts.

### Verification

- `tests/test_exact_first_solver.py`: **8 passed**.
- Setup, fixture, and solver suites together: **18 passed**.
- `python -m compileall -q src tests`: no errors.
- Git blob SHAs for `solver.py`, `bruteforce.py`, the package export, and the final solver test matched the locally executed files.
- The cycle-2 manifest suite was not rerun because the twenty-one manifest files were not reconstructed locally; its separate seven-test record remains unchanged.
- Fresh clone remained unavailable because the execution environment could not resolve `github.com`.
- No GitHub Actions workflow was available.

### Result

The precommitted instrument-disagreement failure condition did not trigger. The exact instrument passed its tiny-fixture correctness gate. This does not prove correctness for all larger games or establish any candidate quality.

### Decision

Advance to one exact-candidate cycle. Commit the experiment before inspecting results, solve strictly in frozen manifest order with the validated no-reduction solver and frozen state, time, and total caps, record capped entries as unsolved, and repeat deterministic fields. Do not run random or shallow screens in that cycle.

### Human intervention

Yoshie Yamada supplied the plain `承認` trigger that enabled this repository cycle. This is **A1** access assistance. Solver architecture, independent oracle design, value and distance convention, tests, correctness interpretation, and next-task selection were autonomous **A0** work.

## 2026-07-17 — Exact candidate screen (cycle 4 of at most 6)

### Work completed

- Committed the formal exact experiment before inspecting candidate outcomes at `9a453ccc2a2e1f30691d23028b12b3296ebb4f13`.
- Reconstructed the live schema, manifest, and solver locally.
- Confirmed the frozen manifest hash and all four hand-audited fixture root and opening values.
- Ran all 18 candidates in frozen manifest order under the frozen per-candidate and study-wide caps.
- Repeated the complete configured run.
- Saved root values, every opening value, exact solved state counts, cap classifications, and measured timings.

### Exact result

- 15 of 18 candidates solved exactly.
- All 9 candidates on 3×3 and 6 of 9 on 4×4 solved.
- Root outcomes: 9 first-participant wins, 6 losses, no draws.
- 4 of 15 solved candidates terminated within 2 optimal plies.
- 14 of 15 terminated within 8 optimal plies.
- 6 candidates had zero non-losing openings.
- `S2-4-CE-02`, `S2-4-LB-01`, and `S2-4-LB-03` reached the 30-second time cap.
- The minimum-solved continuation threshold passed.
- The trivial-majority failure condition did not trigger.

### Reproducibility correction

- The two raw report projection hashes differed.
- The difference was isolated to measured time and the number of states expanded before the three wall-clock time caps.
- The formal script had incorrectly classified time-capped expanded-state counts as deterministic.
- A separate comparator was committed after the discrepancy was observed; it preserved raw measurements and excluded only timing-dependent fields.
- Both runs then produced normalized SHA-256 `9cc17bd02dee865d1e20c67d72a975a04ec36b131d9dfb8bf17de24e6f381eb1`.
- No rules, caps, exact values, or candidate classifications changed.

### Procedural audit

- The frozen proposal required the shallow-search heuristic to be generated before exact results were inspected.
- No heuristic was frozen in cycles 1–3.
- Exact results are now known, so a newly authored heuristic cannot honestly satisfy that requirement.
- The formal shallow screen was cancelled rather than repaired post hoc.
- H2 will remain unresolved and Study 002 cannot receive a fully successful methodological disposition.
- The frozen random screen remains valid because it requires no heuristic.

### Verification limitations

- Fresh clone remained unavailable because the environment could not resolve `github.com`.
- The execution used a functionally reconstructed local copy whose manifest hash and fixture outputs matched live GitHub.
- Byte-identical identity of every reconstructed source file is not claimed.
- No GitHub Actions workflow was available.

### Decision

Advance to a random-only cycle for all 18 candidates, then close in cycle 6 as partial/incomplete. Do not implement a shallow heuristic after exact inspection.

## 2026-07-17 — Random screen and exact comparison (cycle 5 of at most 6)

### Work completed

- Committed the formal random experiment before play at `970b5a7b35b40806b8962c4a73d3841804a95e7a`.
- Added four targeted tests before the formal games at `62cdbb8efd7edc39424396d74b7a00c2cbdad890`.
- Derived an independent seed for every game from the frozen manifest hash, manifest index, and game index.
- Selected uniformly among legal actions only, without importing exact results or shallow-search code.
- Ran exactly 2,000 games for every frozen candidate, 36,000 games total.
- Repeated the complete screen with the GitHub-byte-identical experiment script.
- Compared exact and random results only after both random outputs were complete.

### Random result

- First-participant wins: 17,656.
- Second-participant wins: 18,344.
- Draws: 0.
- Goal endings: 19,715.
- No-legal-action endings: 16,285.
- Mean duration: 6.8161 plies.
- Mean legal actions across all decision points: 5.1395.

### Reproducibility

- The executed experiment file matched live GitHub blob `051ab0fa3de409c38adf35d327ade8111ae597d8` exactly.
- Both complete runs produced deterministic SHA-256 `d3726b0dff560befc4bbc86fa69b7f9aa889d0e41d16f2a54a3b1acc0df7960e`.
- Measured run times were approximately 52.92 and 52.98 seconds.
- Four targeted random-screen tests passed and `compileall` succeeded in the reconstructed environment.

### Exact-versus-random result

Six candidates met the pre-defined false-reassurance condition:

- `S2-3-AG-02`;
- `S2-3-AG-03`;
- `S2-3-CE-03`;
- `S2-4-AG-01`;
- `S2-4-AG-02`;
- `S2-4-CE-01`.

Nine candidates appeared 40–60% under random play. Seven were exactly solved; six of those seven were false-reassurance cases.

Examples include `S2-3-AG-02`, which appeared 54.9% first-participant under random play but was an exact loss in six after every opening, and `S2-4-AG-01`, which appeared 51.55% but had only one winning opening among four.

### Hypothesis status

- H1 supported by six pre-defined false-reassurance cases.
- H3 supported because exact analysis supplied structural reasons hidden by random aggregate rates.
- H2 unresolved because the required pre-result shallow heuristic was never frozen.

### Verification limitations

- The random experiment script was byte-identical to GitHub, but byte-identical identity of every reconstructed schema and manifest dependency is not claimed.
- The reconstruction reproduced the frozen manifest hash and all 18 IDs.
- Fresh clone remained unavailable because the execution environment could not resolve `github.com`.
- No GitHub Actions workflow was available.

### Decision

Advance only to cycle 6 synthesis and closure. Write the final report, classify H1 and H3 as supported and H2 as unresolved, distinguish valid evidence from the heuristic sequencing failure, close Issue #6, and leave no active study. Do not begin Study 003 in that cycle.
